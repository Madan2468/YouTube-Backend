# YouTube-Like Platform Backend

ðŸš€ **Overview** ðŸš€

This project is a backend implementation for a YouTube-like platform, built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. The platform provides a robust and scalable architecture, leveraging **MongoDB** for database management and integrating various features to ensure a secure and dynamic user experience.

## Key Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and logout functionalities.
- **Password Management**: Support for changing and updating passwords with enhanced security.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Secure access and refresh tokens using `jsonwebtoken` for safe and seamless sessions.
- **Channel Subscription**: Subscribe to channels with dynamic updates to subscriber counts.
- **User History Tracking**: Track user activities to provide a personalized experience.
- **File Uploads**: Integrated `multer` for handling avatar (required) and cover image uploads, with support for updating both.
- **Middleware Injection**: Enhanced application security and functionality through strategic middleware injection.
- **Data Encryption**: Passwords are securely encrypted using `bcrypt`.
- **Database Management**: Utilized **MongoDB** with the powerful **aggregate pipeline** to streamline data processing.

## Upcoming Features

I'm currently working on adding the following functionalities:
- **Liked Videos**
- **Playlists**
- **Tweet Integration**
